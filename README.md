    <h1>Task 1: Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>In this task, we aim to train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Loading the Dataset:</strong> We'll use the Iris dataset, which contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. We can load this dataset using the Scikit-learn library.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploring the Dataset:</strong> We'll check the structure of the dataset, including feature names, target names, the shape of the data, and a preview of the data itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Splitting the Dataset:</strong> The dataset will be divided into a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Choosing a Model:</strong> We'll select a suitable machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. Common choices include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Training the Model:</strong> The selected model will be trained using the training data. During training, the model learns the patterns in the data that differentiate between the different species of iris flowers.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> We'll evaluate the trained model's performance using the testing data. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
        <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data, classifying iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following these steps, we can effectively train a machine learning model for iris flower classification using the Iris dataset.</p>

    <h1>Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python</h1>
    <p>Unemployment analysis is crucial, especially during times of economic uncertainty like the Covid-19 pandemic. Here's a structured approach to analyzing unemployment data using Python:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Loading:</strong> We'll start by loading the dataset into Python using the Pandas library, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Exploration:</strong> Understanding the dataset's structure is essential. We'll examine the first few rows of the dataset to get a glimpse of its contents.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and fixing data inconsistencies are crucial steps in data preprocessing. We'll ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Visualizations such as histograms, density plots, and count plots help us gain insights into the unemployment data. We'll use Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Visualizations are powerful tools for communicating findings effectively. By exploring unemployment data using Python, we can gain valuable insights into trends and patterns, aiding decision-making processes.</li>
